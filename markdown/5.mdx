### Boosting Location Visibility: A Case Study on Tharwa Town Corniche

At Multixion, we specialize in enhancing our clients' online presence, ensuring their visibility in key digital spaces. Our recent project with Saudi Tharwa for their location at Tharwa Town Corniche is a testament to how strategic ad management can dramatically improve business outcomes. In this blog, we'll walk you through our journey with Tharwa Town Corniche, detailing the steps we took to elevate their location's visibility and engagement on Google Maps.

#### Understanding the Client's Needs

Saudi Tharwa approached us with a significant challenge: their location at Tharwa Town Corniche was not gaining the online visibility it deserved. Their previous ad campaign had underperformed, and they needed a comprehensive strategy to boost their presence on Google Maps and attract more visitors. Our mission was to optimize their ad setup and create a campaign that would significantly increase their visibility and engagement.

##### Challenge 1: Optimizing Asset Groups

###### The Problem:

The initial ad setup for Tharwa Town Corniche lacked properly organized asset groups, which resulted in ineffective targeting and poor ad performance.

###### Our Solution:

We began by conducting a thorough audit of their existing campaign. The fundamental principles we applied here were structure and precision.

**Structure:** We reorganized the asset groups to ensure that each one was tailored to specific aspects of Tharwa Town Corniche, such as popular attractions, dining options, and scenic views. This allowed for more precise targeting and relevance in the ads.

**Precision:** By refining the asset groups, we ensured that the ads were shown to the most relevant audience, increasing the likelihood of clicks and engagement.

##### Challenge 2: Creating an Effective Ad Campaign

###### The Problem:

Tharwa Town Corniche’s previous ad campaign, running from July 23, 2024, to August 15, 2024, resulted in only 245 clicks and 5.08K impressions. The campaign needed a significant overhaul to achieve better results.

###### Our Solution:

We developed a new ad campaign with a focus on visibility and engagement. Key principles here included targeting and content optimization.

**Targeting:** We implemented precise location-based targeting to ensure that the ads reached potential visitors within a relevant geographical area. This was crucial in attracting both local residents and tourists.

**Content Optimization:** We crafted compelling ad copy and visuals that highlighted the unique features of Tharwa Town Corniche, making the location more appealing to potential visitors.

##### Challenge 3: Enhancing Visibility and Engagement

###### The Problem:

Despite being a prominent location, Tharwa Town Corniche struggled with low visibility on Google Maps and limited engagement from online users.

###### Our Solution:

We launched the optimized ad campaign on August 13, 2024, and within a week, the results were significant. The key principles here were visibility and engagement.

**Visibility:** Through our efforts, Tharwa Town Corniche’s ad achieved 6.39K clicks and 133K impressions in just seven days—a remarkable improvement over the previous campaign. This boost in visibility ensured that the location was highlighted more prominently on Google Maps.

**Engagement:** The increase in clicks demonstrated that the ads were not only being seen but were also resonating with the audience, leading to higher engagement with the location.

##### Conclusion

Our work with Tharwa Town Corniche exemplifies the impact of strategic digital marketing and ad management. By focusing on precise targeting, content optimization, and asset group organization, we were able to dramatically improve their online visibility and engagement.
